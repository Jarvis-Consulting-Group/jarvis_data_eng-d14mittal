    description: Built a Linux Cluster Monitoring Application used for collecting and monitoring the hardware-related data of virtual machines. Implemented the application with Bash Scripts, PostgreSQL and Docker Technologies. We created a docker container using the psql_docker.sh running Postgre:Alpine-9.6 and provisioned a PSQL instance CLI in our system. The ddl.sql script is responsible for connecting to the host_agent, creating the host_info and host_usage tables. The host_info.sh and host_usage.sh are fetching the hardware specs and real-time data with bash scripting and inserting data into the database tables. Configured the crontab as well to capture real-time data every minute.
