## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-d14mittal](https://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-d14mittal)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/Jarvis-Consulting-Group/jarvis_data_eng-d14mittal/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Built a Linux Cluster Monitoring Application used for collecting and monitoring the hardware-related data of virtual machines. Implemented the application with Bash Scripts, PostgreSQL and Docker Technologies. We created a docker container using the psql_docker.sh running Postgre:Alpine-9.6 and provisioned a PSQL instance CLI in our system. The ddl.sql script is responsible for connecting to the host_agent, creating the host_info and host_usage tables. The host_info.sh and host_usage.sh are fetching the hardware specs and real-time data with bash scripting and inserting data into the database tables. Configured the crontab as well to capture real-time data every minute.


## Highlighted Projects
**Movie Catalog System with Microservices** [[GitHub](https://github.com/d14mittal/Movie-Ratings-Microservice-Application)]: Built a back-end microservices architecture retrieving a user's movie rating and movie info from the internal data collection set via API into consolidated data. Implemented service discovery and microservice registry using Eureka for service registry and load balancing.

**Employee Management System** [[GitHub](https://github.com/d14mittal/Employee-Management-System)]: Developed a full-Stack application maintaining the record of employees in a company. The projects aims to store vital information of an employee in a MySQL database and allowing the user to interact with a user interface built using React.js. The backend services/REST API have been handled using the Spring boot and Spring Data JPA.
